config SND_SOC_SPRD_AUDIO_USE_AON_DMA
	bool "Use AON DMA when sound playback"
	depends on SND_SOC_SPRD_AUDIO_BUFFER_USE_IRAM && DMA_SPRD && SND_SOC_SPRD_AUDIO_DMA_ENGINE
	help
	  Say Y if you want to use AON DMA when playback, sometimes,
	   AON DMA maybe reduce power consumption. But AON DMA can only
	   access IRAM, so we must depend on IRAM switch.
