config SIPC_SPIPE
	bool "sprd pipe driver based on SBUF"
	default n
	depends on SIPC
	help
	  This driver is a pipe driver base on SBUF, which create
	  general pipes between AP & CP.

config SIPC_SPOOL
       bool "sprd pool driver based on SBLOCK"
       default n
       depends on SIPC
       help
        This driver is a pool driver base on SBLOCK, which create
        general pools between AP & CP.

config SIPC_SETH
       bool "Sprd Ethernet driver"
       default n
       depends on SIPC
       help
         This driver supports the Spreadtrum Ethernet based on share
         memory. Say Y here if you want to use it.

config SETH_OPT
      bool "Enable performance optimization for SETH (2 Bytes reserved & US gather)"
      default n
      depends on SIPC_SETH
      help
        Starting from SharkL, the Seth driver is optimized for data thransfer
	performance, but that is not compatible with former products
	like TShark. Enable this configuration, IF the modem end surports
	these optimizations: 2 Bytes reserved in sblock field and packets gathering
	in upstreaming direction.

config SETH_GRO_DISABLE
       bool "Disable the gro function in seth"
       default n
       depends on SIPC_SETH
       help
         GRO function is incompatible with the samsung's GrandPrime, this will make
	 it happen kernel panic and IPV6 download too low. Enable this configuration
	 will let us to bypass these problems temporarily.

config SBLOCK_SHARE_BLOCKS
      bool "Enable all sblocks used by SETH share one block pool"
      default n
      depends on SIPC_SETH
      help
        Starting from SharkL4M, this optimization can reduce the
	reserved memory usage.Shall confim cp also support it.

      default n
      depends on SIPC_SETH
      help
        Starting from SharkL5.1, use SIPX to replace SBlock or Seblock for SETH.
config SIPCMEM_CACHE_EN
